                    Welcome to Kehilas Lev V'Nefesh

                    Nestled in the heart of Bergenfield, NJ, Kehilas Lev V'Nefesh stands 
                    as a beacon of warmth, acceptance, and spiritual growth. Our name, 
                    translating to "Community of Heart and Soul," reflects our 
                    core missionâ€”a shul for everyone, where the essence of 
                    Jewish life pulsates through every service, program, and gathering.
                </p>  
                <h4>
                    Our Mission
                </h4>
                <p>    
                    At Kehilas Lev V'Nefesh, we believe that the doors to 
                    spirituality and community should be open to all, regardless of 
                    background. Our mission is simple yet 
                    profound: to create a space where everyone feels welcome, 
                    and where the heart and soul of Judaism are not just taught 
                    but deeply felt and lived. We are committed to fostering a 
                    supportive environment that encourages meaningful connections, 
                    spiritual exploration, and personal growth.
                </p>  
                <h4>
                    Our Beginnings
                </h4> 
                <p>  
                    Founded during the challenging times of COVID-19, Kehilas Lev 
                    V'Nefesh emerged as a response to the community's yearning for a 
                    more inclusive, heart-centered place of worship. Our founders 
                    envisioned a shul where the emphasis on the heart and soul of each 
                    individual would shine brightly, creating a spiritual home that felt 
                    both comforting and inspiring. This vision has guided us from our 
                    inception and continues to illuminate our path forward.
                </p>    
                <h4>

                    journey. While we may not highlight specific programs or activities
